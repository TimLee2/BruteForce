# BruteForce
A simple brute force program matching up to four characters.

A user-defined string named 'test' will be compared against all possible n-number of character combinations until a match is found equal to 'test'. The matching string will then be encrypted.

The 'test' string needs to be changed manually.

Compile using [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/):
g++ bruteforce.cpp -o [ExecutableName]
